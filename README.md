# -Harry-Potter-Invisibility-Cloak-OpenCV-Magic-
Remember the classic, award winning novel series, Harry Potter?
Also, remember of Harry's Christmas
A fun computer vision project that makes you disappear on camera using color detection — just like Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak! Built with Python and OpenCV, this project uses real-time video masking to replace your cloak with the background. 🧙‍♂️✨
